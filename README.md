What is the Friday Night Funkin Never 2 Engine?

This is a universal engine for the game Friday Night Funkin made 
by Ninjamuffin99, The engine itself is made by me. The whole game 
is put on the Clickteam Fusion engine. The engine itself is still 
in the works. You can follow the progress on my GameJolt!
