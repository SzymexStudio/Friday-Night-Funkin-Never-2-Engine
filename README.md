Friday Night Funkin Never 2 Engine Project Repository!

What is the Friday Night Funkin Never 2 Engine?

This is a universal engine for the game Friday Night Funkin made 
by Ninjamuffin99, The engine itself is made by me. The whole game 
is put on the Clickteam Fusion engine. The engine itself is still 
in the works. You can follow the progress on my GameJolt!

## *Create the Best Mod for **Friday Night Funkin** in a Simple Way!

Our Engine is supposed to be easy to use and contain a lot of necessary 
functions. We are trying to make sure that our engine has enough features 
to make the best mod for Friday Night Funkin.

We will want our engine to be as convenient to use as possible. 
contained enough features to create advanced mods that require delving into the source code 
without having to delve into the source code. We want to make all this easy.

**YOU NEED CLICKTEAM FUSION 2.5+ 292.22 TO USE SOURCE CODE (For now, but we will try to port to older versions of clickteam.)**

Our Engine contains more than the usual Friday Night Funkin.

**2. Engine Functionality**

Due to the fact that Clickteam Fusion has certain limitations the engine also has them. So loading 
graphics has some limitations, but the engine is optimized in this regard, so you do not have to worry 
about lag in the game. Back to the limitations. Here is a list of limitations for which we do not have a 
solution at the moment. 

**2.1 Restrictions**
 - **Changing characters during a song.**
    - This causes terrible lags that are not welcome in the game. Of course, we are still thinking how to solve this problem
 - **Animations in the scene.**
    - Clickteam does not allow you to create Animations in the object while the application is running. However, that we already have a plan how to make Animation  objects in scenes only that it would be a limited number of objects.
- **Custom Font in DX11**
  - Unfortunately to use fonts in DX11 you have to create a mod in source code, Clickteam fusion unfortunately has problems with loading fonts from external files in DX11
