**2. Engine Functionality**

Due to the fact that Clickteam Fusion has certain limitations the engine also has them. So loading 
graphics has some limitations, but the engine is optimized in this regard, so you do not have to worry 
about lag in the game. Back to the limitations. Here is a list of limitations for which we do not have a 
solution at the moment. 

**2.1 Restrictions**
 - **Changing characters during a song.**
    - This causes terrible lags that are not welcome in the game. Of course, we are still thinking how to solve this problem
 - **Animations in the scene.**
    - Clickteam does not allow you to create Animations in the object while the application is running. However, that we already have a plan how to make Animation  objects in scenes only that it would be a limited number of objects.
